HEADLINE: A Refugee's Story

TEXT:

One of the women from China's Fujian province told a compelling story to
the Immigration and Refugee Board yesterday.

She is applying to be accepted as a refugee to Canada. She was on one of
the boats from China that was intercepted by the Coast Guard off the
coast of British Columbia earlier this year.

According to international law, a refugee is a person who has a
well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,
nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political
opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to be
protected by his own country.

The Chinese woman can't be identified because of a legal order, but it
seems her claim to be accepted as a refugee to Canada may succeed where
the claims of 32 people who arrived with her have failed. They will be
sent back to China.

The woman says that seven years ago she got pregnant for the second
time. That violates a Chinese law. Couples in China are only allowed to
have one child. She tried to hide from the authorities, but they found
her when she was eight months pregnant and took her to hospital.

She said through an interpreter, "The baby was born alive. They put the
baby in a bucket. I heard the baby crying for a short time and I wanted
to hold the baby but I couldn't. Later, the doctor told me the baby was
no longer living."

When she heard a ship was going to Canada, she decided to get on board.
She planned to seek refugee status and bring her husband and child.

So far, every refugee claim from the Chinese migrants has been rejected,
usually because the board has found no evidence of persecution.

This case may be different.

The woman also says her family received a notice that she'll be
sterilized so she can't have any more babies if she returns to China.

Larry Smeets, her lawyer, says the Federal Court of Appeal has concluded
in the past that forced sterilization was a form of persecution, so this
reason could be recognized as a reason for refugees to be allowed to
remain in Canada.

Since there is little evidence beyond the woman's own testimony, the
decision depends on whether the board members believe she is telling the
truth.
