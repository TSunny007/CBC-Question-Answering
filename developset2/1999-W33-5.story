Lunenburg Harbour, one of Canada's most famous ports, is facing an
unpleasant problem.

Every day in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, millions of litres of sewage run
into the harbour.

Each year, more tourists from all over the world come to visit
Lunenburg. As more people visit the town, more sewage gets dumped into
the water.

Now town officials want the federal and provincial governments to help
clean up the harbour.

Many people come to visit Lunenburg because the town is a United Nations
World Heritage Site. It's a distinction it shares with only one other
Canadian city, Old Quebec.

Lunenburg Harbour is famous for being the home of the Bluenose and the
Bluenose II.

The Bluenose was a famous schooner ship that raced for the International
Fisherman's Trophy. The first International Fisherman's Trophy race was in 1920. It started as a friendly competition between US and Canadian fishing schooners.
The Bluenose was one of the most successful racing schooners. The Bluenose won the race four times.

In 1942, the Bluenose was sold to carry freight and cargo to the West
Indies. In January 1946, it went down after striking a reef in the
Caribbean Sea.

In 1955, both the Bluenose and its captain, Angus Walters, were inducted
into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame for their achievements in the
International Fisherman's Trophy races. A picture of the Bluenose has
been on the tails side of Canadian dimes since 1937.

The Bluenose II is a replica of the original Bluenose. It was built
from the same plans, in the same shipyard, and by some of the same men
who built the original. The Bluenose and Lunenburg are important parts
of Canadian history.

This is why the sewage is a concern.

The Mayor says the federal government agreed to help maintain the area
when Lunenburg applied for UN World Heritage Site status.

Now the Mayor wants the federal and provincial governments to pay half
the cost of cleaning up Lunenburg Harbour.

The Mayor says increasing people's taxes to pay for the cleanup is not
the answer. The Mayor also admits that federal and provincial
governments shouldn't normally help pay for a community's sewage
treatment.

But the Mayor feels Lunenburg is a special case because of it's an
historical site.
