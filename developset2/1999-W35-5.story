How much time does the average Canadian kid spend watching television each week? 5 hours? 10 hours? 23 hours?

If you answered 23 hours, you're right. By the time most of you finish
high school, you will have spent more time listening to actors than
teachers.

A new study shows Canadian kids are spending almost one full day a week
glued to their television screens. And many doctors think there are
several reasons why too much TV is not good for kids.

A group representing Canadian pediatricians - doctors who specialize in
treating children - may have a new question for parents when they take
their children for a checkup: How much television do your kids watch?

The Canadian Pediatric Society wants doctors to monitor how much time
children are sitting in front of electronic screens. That's because
excessive and inappropriate exposure can harm a child's physical, mental
and social skills.

The society wants parents to limit preschoolers to one hour of TV a day,
while school children should watch no more than two hours daily.

At current Canadian rates, the average high school graduate will have
spent more time watching TV than they did learning in a classroom.

Pediatricians say that not all television is bad. But there is a
relationship between watching television and an increase in violent
behaviour.

The pediatricians believe television viewing frequently limits
children's time to develop vital activities such as playing, reading,
learning to talk, spending time with friends and family, storytelling,
getting regular exercise, and developing other physical, mental and
social skills. They also believe that too much time in front of the TV
may contribute to childhood obesity.

The pediatricians have come up with a list of ways of promoting good
television viewing habits. Among the suggested habits are
recommendations for parents to watch television with their children and
discuss the programs. The pediatricians also believe televisions should
be turned off during meal times.
