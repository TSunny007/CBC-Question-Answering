HEADLINE: Newfoundland's Contaminated Tap Water

TEXT:

The Newfoundland government has found that the tap water in 63
communities is contaminated. The water contains higher than acceptable
levels of chemicals known as trihalomethanes or THMs.

These potentially dangerous chemicals have been linked to cancer and
miscarriages (failed pregnancies). They are formed when tiny amounts of
chlorine are added to drinking water. Chlorine - also known as "bleach"
- is also added to the water in many swimming pools. You've no doubt
noticed the smell.

The danger of trihalomethanes in drinking water is faced mainly by small
towns that can't afford expensive water filtration systems.

Chlorination is necessary for two reasons. First, almost all sources
of water contain microbiological organisms which have to be removed to
prevent the outbreak of diseases such as typhoid fever and cholera. 
Second, once the treated water leaves the treatment plant, it travels
through water pipes. During this trip, from the plant to your tap, it is
necessary to have a disinfectant in the water to guard against the
regrowth of microorganisms.

Nova Scotia also recently identified 18 communities with unacceptably
high levels of trihalomethanes.

Newfoundland's environment minister says he plans to hire an expert
who will look into reducing the amount of THMs in the water supply.

In the meantime, Oliver Langdon says people shouldn't panic.

"People should not be alarmed about this matter. The benefits of
disinfecting our water far outweigh the health effects of THMs."

Many Newfoundland residents are upset with the government. They say the
government has known there were problems but hid the facts from the
public. Fogo town manager Bruce Pomeroy says that the government "should
have made everyone aware if there were risks -- like they are doing now
-- two years ago."

There are easy ways of getting rid of many of the THMs in drinking
water.

You can leave water in an open container for 24 hours, and many of the
chemicals will evaporate. You can also pour the water through a
charcoal-based water filter, like the popular ones many people keep in
the fridge. The charcoal will absorb the chemicals.
