HEADLINE: An Unwelcome Visitor

TEXT:

Austrian politician Joerg Haider has ended a controversial two-day visit
to Canada.

The leader of Austria's Freedom Party flew out of Montreal, Quebec's
Dorval airport last night. Haider is accused of being a Nazi sympathizer.

Haider has made remarks, for which he has since apologized, that
downplay Nazi crimes in Germany in the 1930's and during the Second
World War. He has not publicly made anti-Semitic (anti-Jewish) remarks
and has said that his party has Jewish members.

Haider arrived in Montreal for a visit shrouded in secrecy.

Jewish and human rights groups in Canada and the United States condemned
his visit. Dozens of people made signs and set up protest marches in
Ottawa and Montreal.

Rabbi Marvin Hier said he understood Haider had flown to Montreal to try
to attend the wedding of a well known Hasidic leader's relative on
Wednesday evening.

Hasidic Jews believe that religion governs every minute of their life.
They are the most visible members of the Jewish community because even
their clothes reflect their beliefs.

Hundreds of thousands of Hasidic Jews were killed by Nazis.

Heshy Weinberger, a spokesman for the Tash Hasidic community in a
Montreal suburb, says it is not true that Heider was invited to attend
the wedding.

Weinberger says the community, which counts many Holocaust survivors
among its 300 families, was overwhelmed by the controversy sparked by
rumors that they had invited Haider.

On Wednesday, Haider's associates requested a tour of Montreal's
Holocaust Memorial Center, but were told they could not visit. Haider
was also photographed playfully juggling a snowball at the city's
memorial to Raoul Wallenberg, a European hero who saved many Jews during
the holocaust.

This seems to prove accusations that the two-day trip was a bid for
publicity.

In an interview published in Montreal's The Gazette, Haider said he and
the Freedom Party he leads are being unfairly demonized as neo-fascists
by his opponents.

Haider's party won 27 percent of the vote in Austria's last election,
and earlier this month they joined the conservative People's Party in a
coalition government. Since then, many European nations have shunned Austria, and its relations with the United States and Canada have been strained.
