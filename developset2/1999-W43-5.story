TEXT:

The Youth News Network, a news show that airs in some Canadian schools,
is in trouble in Manitoba.

YNN is a private company that gives schools free equipment - like
televisions and computers - to make sure it has an audience for its
commercial news service.

YNN presents a 12-minute daily feature shown during class time. All
students must watch it. The feature includes two and a half minutes of
commercials.

YNN makes a profit by selling advertising space. Advertisers have a
captive teenage audience. They can make their ads specifically for
students between 12 and 17. So far the ads have been about breakfast
cereals and computer games.

Earlier this year, CBC4Kids ran stories about how schools in Quebec and
Ontario are testing out the controversial concept in some classrooms.

The news this week is that YNN is being kicked out of Manitoba classrooms.

The move, announced by Manitoba's new NDP government, follows through on
a promise the party made in the September provincial election campaign.

"We will not have commercials and products being sold in the
classrooms," says Education Minister Drew Caldwell.

"We need to ensure more class time - not less - is spent on teaching
basics, like physical education and arts, for a more well-rounded
education."

As of the end of June, schools in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,
Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland had agreed to show the news program run
by Montreal-based Athena Educational Partners. British Columbia, Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick rejected the idea.

Within a couple of months, Athena had scaled back its plans and instead
decided on a six-month trial run in 20 schools beginning in October.

Eight schools in Manitoba agreed to show the program on a six-month
trial basis. But they will not be allowed to extend those contracts,
says Caldwell.
