TEXT:

Prime Minister Jean Chretien says Canada will send as many as 600
soldiers to East Timor. They will be part of a United Nations
peacekeeping force.

The island of Timor lies between Indonesia and Australia. It is home to
about 700,000 people.

Two weeks ago, the eastern half of the island voted to become
independent from Indonesia. The Indonesian army and local military
groups who oppose independence have launched violent attacks ever since.

The East Timor capitol city of Dili has been turned into a burning,
looted ghost town.

For the past week Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has refused to allow
United Nations peacekeeping troops into his country. He said that the
conflict in East Timor was a matter for Indonesians to work out between
themselves.

But yesterday the Indonesian President changed his mind. It appears he
has given in to pressure from governments and human rights activists
from around the world. President Habibie says he will now allow the UN
troops in to stop the violence.

Prime Minister Chretien expects Canada to have troops in East Timor
within 30 days.

Right now, Canada has about 3,900 peacekeepers on 22 missions around the
world. Many are working in Eastern Europe. UN peacekeepers were sent to
the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo at the beginning of the summer. The
peacekeeping troops are making sure that the people living in war-torn
Kosovo are protected from violence.
