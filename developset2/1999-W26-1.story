HEADLINE: The War in Yugoslavia is Officially Over

TEXT:

Now that the Yugoslavian army has completely withdrawn from the
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, NATO's military campaign in Yugoslavia
is officially over.

Over the weekend, NATO authorities also reached a peace deal with the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a group of Yugoslavians of Albanian
heritage who were fighting against the Yugoslavian army. The deal says
that KLA members will hand over their large weapons to NATO forces and
stop wearing military uniforms.

Now the war-torn region in eastern Europe is faced with the enormous
task of rebuilding and overcoming the ethnic hatred that started the
conflict.

Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians are still in refugee camps in
the countries surrounding Yugoslavia. Thousands of others are refugees
in countries around the world, including Canada. These people must now
make the decision if - or when - they will go home.

Thousands of Yugolsavians of Serbian heritage have now been chased from
Kosovo by the people of Albanian heritage who have returned. One of the
major questions is this: what will happen to those Serbs who decide to
remain in Kosovo? Will Albanians and Serbs be able to live together in
peace?

The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia destroyed hundreds of roads, bridges,
factories, oil refineries, electric generating plants and office
buildings. Many thousands of people were killed - both by the NATO bombs
and by Serbian soldiers.

It could cost more than a hundred billion dollars to rebuild what NATO
destroyed in Yugoslavia.

Over the weekend the leaders of the world's eight leading industrialized
countries, known as the Group of Eight or the G8, met in Cologne,
Germany. The G8 countries are: Germany, The United States, Canada,
Japan, Russia, France, Britain, and Italy. At the top of the agenda was
coming up with a plan to rebuild the region and make sure that a lasting
peace can be maintained.

Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs says the peace process will make
an effort to "democratize" Kosovo, aiming for eventual elections. A
civilian administration will likely look after this end of business.

"I don't think there's any doubt that we want to see a democratic
society there -- that's the only way that you're going to bring ultimate
peace, stability and reconstruction to the area," says Canada's Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy. "I think that those processes are under
way already in Serbia. I think that you'll be seeing a new political
dynamic emerging in that region."

Over the next few days, weeks and months, the world will also be
watching to see what happens with Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic, who is still in power.

One thing appears certain -- Milosevic will not be leaving Yugoslavia.
He has been charged with war crimes by the International Criminal
Tribunal. The Tribunal is trying to arrest people who have broken
international humanitarian law.

If Mr. Milosevic tries to leave Yugoslavia he could be arrested and
taken to court in The Hague, The Netherlands, where the court is
located. And there he would be put on trial. If he was found guilty he
could spend many, many years in jail.
