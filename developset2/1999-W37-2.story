TEXT:

French President Jacques Chirac was full of praise yesterday for the
people and the art of Nunavut. He also couldn't resist picking up a few
souvenirs.

A fan of Inuit art, President Chirac selected sculptures of a walrus and
a polar bear, crafted by artists in Cape Dorset, a Baffin Island
community known for its high-quality art.

Earlier Chirac gave the impression he would leave the territory
empty-handed.

"What I would like to buy, I cannot afford," he had said. "And what I
can afford is not very interesting. But I still like to look at them.
Besides, I already have a small collection."

Nunavut means "our land" in the Inuktitut language of Canada's Inuit. It
became Canada's newest territory on April 1. Nunavut covers two million
square kilometres in the eastern Arctic.

President Chirac is the first foreign leader to visit the territory. He
arrived in the Nunavut capital of Iqaluit on Sunday accompanied by
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.

Speaking to the legislative assembly of the new territory, the President
praised its 25,000 residents.

"I salute the determination of the Inuit to secure recognition of their
rights," he said. "Here is a vast country, the land of the aboriginal people, the land of the Inuit, at once English and French speaking, that is
perfecting the art of living together in a spirit of peace and
tolerance."

Prime Minister Chretien, who was kept busy shaking hands with Nunavut
residents, said President Chirac's visit was a boost for the territory.

"The art industry is very important here. Thirty per cent of the income
here comes from this industry, and this visit will help start
a tourism industry."

President Chirac was accompanied by many French journalists and
photographers. The French media consider the Canadian North exotic, and
the photos of Mr. Chirac in the Inuit territory are sure to appear in
magazines and newspapers in France.

Chirac visited a community hall run by the Nunavut Francophone
Association, where he opened a virtual museum of Inuit art on
the Internet, a project financed by the French government.
