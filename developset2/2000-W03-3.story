TEXT:

The Federal government has come up with an idea to keep National Hockey
League teams in Canada.

Various levels of government will give millions of dollars to the teams
in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver to help
them stay in business.

The money will come from taxpayers.

NHL teams like the Ottawa Senators and the Edmonton Oilers have said for
years that they are going broke. They have threatened to move to the
United States - where they say business is better - unless the
government helps them out.

Yesterday Industry Minister John Manley finally agreed. He has given the
go-ahead to negotiate subsidies (money given to help out) on a
team-by-team basis. Some teams will get more. Others will get less. The
subsidies could add up to millions of dollars.

The reaction to the program has been very mixed.

In the Montreal Canadiens dressing room, winger Turner Stevenson of
Prince George, British Columbia, is very happy.

"People see it as the government giving us free money, but look how much
tax we pay," he says. "Guys make a million, but they pay half of that in
taxes."

The average NHL player makes 1.3 million dollars a season.

But Olympic 100 metre sprinter Glenroy Gilbert is disgusted. He says
that it is not fair that millionaire hockey players like Turner
Stevenson and Pavel Bure are getting help while hundreds of Olympic
athletes have to scramble every month just to pay their bills.

"I've been doing this for 13 or 14 years, running on the national team
and we've been forced to live on from $450 a month to $810 a month,"
Gilbert said from Austin, Texas, where he is training for the Sydney
Olympics. "That barely pays your rent."

Other groups are equally upset.

Frank Gilbert represents Vancouver's Downtown Eastside Residents
Association. He says his group struggles on a daily basis to help with
basic needs of the poor. Putting money into NHL hockey is fine, Gilbert
says, as long as the poor are taken care of first -- and he says that
hasn't happened. He says professional hockey is a luxury, but heat and
food are not.

Manitoba Agriculture Minister Rosann Wowchuk calls it a slap in the face
to farmers who have been lobbying Ottawa for help.

The Federal government plan to give the teams money will last four
years.
