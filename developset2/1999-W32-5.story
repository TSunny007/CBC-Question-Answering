HEADLINE: Mudslides cover Trans-Canada highway

TEXT:

Mudslides roared across part of the Trans-Canada highway, near Banff,
Alberta. The mudslides narrowly missed several cars and stranded
hundreds of travelers. Heavy rains near the B.C. - Alberta border
caused the slides.

The mud was one metre deep in some areas of the road, and at its height
covered all four lanes of the divided highway.

After many hours of work, clean up crews were able to re-open the parts
of the highway.

Parks Canada say it will take several days before all the debris is
cleared, and traffic returns to normal.

Mudslides often occur in steep and mountainous areas. They are usually
caused by weakened land on hills and mountains. Rivers, glaciers, heavy
rainfall, melting snow, earthquakes, or even thunder can weaken the
land.

Once a slope is weakened, almost anything can start a mudslide.
Rainstorms are a common cause of mudslides. In heavy storms, water soaks
into the ground faster than it can run off. Water pressure loosens soil
and rocks. When soil and rocks break loose, they become a mass of wet
earth that starts a mudslide.

Mudslides can move quickly and powerfully, picking up rocks, trees,
houses and cars.

As the debris moves into rivers, bridges can become blocked or even
collapse, making a temporary dam that can flood neighbouring areas.
