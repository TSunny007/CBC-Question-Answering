HEADLINE: Nova Scotia elects a new government

TEXT:

John Hamm has been elected the new Premier of Nova Scotia. Hamm is the
leader of the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Party.

The PC party defeated both the Liberal Party government led by Premier
Russell MacLellan and Robert Chisholm's New Democratic Party.

The election was not as close as many experts thought it would be. The
Conservatives were able to win a majority government, meaning they will
have more members in the legislature than both parties combined. The
Conservatives won 29 seats, the New Democrats 12 and the Liberals 11.

After the last election Nova Scotia had a minority government. That
means that no one party had more than half the seats in the
legislature.

Hamm has promised to cut people's taxes within three years. He also
plans to reduce the number of government workers.

Hamm is a 61-year-old doctor with only six years of political
experience. His majority win was a comeback for the PC Party. The party
placed third in the last election.

Liberal leader Russell MacLellan was forced to call the election after
the other parties voted against his budget. When the government is
defeated on a major bill, like one that is about money, it means the
legislature has lost confidence in them. This vote of non-confidence
means the premier must either quit, or call a new election. MacLellan
decided to call a new election. He says he will stay on as leader of the
Nova Scotia Liberal Party despite losing his job as premier.
