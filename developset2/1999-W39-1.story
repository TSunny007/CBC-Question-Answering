"Parlez-vous francais?" (Do you speak French?)

Francophones (French speakers) in the Northwest Territories say that
their rights are being ignored. And that is making them angry.

So angry, in fact, that the association representing francophones in the
Northwest Territories will be taking the territorial and federal
governments to court.

There are a couple of thousand French speakers in the Northwest
Territories, or about 2 people out every 100.

They say the territorial government isn't respecting its own language
law.

The federation found that 75 per cent of the documents it had requested
from the territorial government in French were unavailable. That was the
result of a one-day survey conducted for them last February.

"The report itself, coming from the NWT language commissioner, is not
even published in French," says Andre Legare, the president of the
federation. "So you can see there's a real problem here."

Roger Lepage is the lawyer representing the federation. He says the
federal government has the responsibility to impose the charter of
rights and freedoms giving French and English equal status. "Ultimately
it's the federal government that is responsible for ensuring the
equality of French and English in the territories, not only in the
Northwest Territories, but also in Nunavut and in the Yukon."

The case should be presented to the Northwest Territories Supreme Court
next month.
