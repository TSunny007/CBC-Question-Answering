TEXT:

Inmates at a prison in Iqaluit, on Baffin Island in the North West
Territories (soon to be Nunavut) are being given something that few
prisoners in the world are allowed: guns.

The goal is to show some wayward Inuit the traditional ways.

On a typical day in this northern community, a hunting party
is about to head out. This one includes two prisoners from
the Baffin Correctional Centre (BCC), both convicted of assault,
both trying to reconnect with Inuit traditions and culture.

Moshe Akavak, a guard with the BCC says learning the traditional
ways will help the prisoners' rehabilitation. "If they go out,
they keep themselves busy doing hunting, repairing equipment, it's
good for them."

The party is hunting caribou, far from the city on the frozen
tundra.

Michael Evic is serving a two-year sentence for assault and
other crimes. Out on the tundra with the hunting party he
aims at his prey with a high powered rifle. His first shot
misses. He tries again. This time he's successful.

Inuit believe it takes more than killing an animal to become a
hunter. What happens afterwards is just as important.

Part of the instruction is learning how to carefully skin and
carve a caribou the way Inuit have always done it.

When Moshe Akavak became a jail guard 16 years ago, he
was appalled so many Inuit had lost their traditional skills.
He believes that's why some became criminals.

"Anything they learn from the land program, or from other
people, of course, they will be willing to pass on to their
children."

He says over the years hundreds of prisoners have been
given guns and knives and taught how to use them. There's
never been a problem. "The more you trust other people,
you also gain it back."

This is just one of the traditional hunting programs for
prisoners. In the summer they go after seals. Depending on
how well they do they could be sent to an outpost camp
where they'll hunt and fish for months at a time.

It's all very expensive, costing tens of thousands of dollars
for equipment, clothing and supervision. But many believe
it's money well spent.

"Whenever you have inmates that come out of jail feeling
good about themselves and wanting to succeed I think that
cost is well borne out in terms of perhaps reduced
recidivism [a return to committing crimes].  And I think you have the
chance for these
people to return to their communities and contribute," says
John McKnight, warden of the centre.

The prisoners, like Michael Evic, believe learning traditional
hunting skills will straighten out their lives. "I'll just keep on
working and go hunting on weekends and keep out of
booze or drugs, that was my problem," Evic says.
