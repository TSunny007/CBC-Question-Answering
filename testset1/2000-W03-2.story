TEXT:

After more than a month of searching for a signal from NASA's Mars Polar
Lander, mission controllers have given up hope of finding it.

The Mars Polar Lander was on a mission to Mars to study its atmosphere
and search for water, something that could help scientists determine
whether life ever existed on Mars.

Polar Lander was to have touched down December 3 for a 90-day mission.
It was to land near Mars' south pole.

The lander was last heard from minutes before beginning its descent.

The last effort to communicate with the three-legged lander ended with
frustration at 8 a.m Monday.

"We didn't see anything," said Richard Cook, the spacecraft's project
manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The failed mission to the Red Planet cost the American government more
than $200 million dollars.

Now, space agency scientists and engineers will try to find out what
could have gone wrong. They do not want to make the same mistakes in the
next mission. Controllers have been testing dozens of different
scenarios to try and explain what might have happened to the lander.

Nobody knows exactly what happened to the lander, but there are several
theories.

The Mars Polar Lander could have touched down on the side of a canyon
and toppled over. Some people think the lander could have exploded
before entering the atmosphere. Others say its radio systems might have
failed, or that the lander could have sunk into Martian dust.

NASA sent a spacecraft called the Mars Global Surveyor to take
high-resolution
images of the landing site to search for signs of the lander. NASA hoped
the orbiter would spot the lander's parachute or shadow. But so far
attempts to capture a picture of the lander's parachute have been
unsuccessful.

Another lander and orbiter are scheduled to launch next year, but at
least part of the mission is now in doubt.

"The orbiter for sure will happen. There's no issue there,"
Mr. Cook says. "The lander they're still talking about."

The Polar Lander Spacecraft was 1.06 metres tall by 3.6 metres wide. Its
total weight was 576 kilograms.
