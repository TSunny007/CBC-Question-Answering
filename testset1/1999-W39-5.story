TEXT:

Montreal police arrested more than 250 high school students yesterday.

Thirty-five students and one adult were arrested earlier in the week.
They are protesting the lack of extra-curricular activities in schools.

Montreal teachers are in contract discussions with the provincial
government. To put pressure on the government, they are refusing to do
any activities that are not paid.

That's meant that there are no football practices, or school trips, or
special classes after school. Those are all activities that teachers do
on their own time.

The students who were arrested face $100 fines.

Deputy police director Serge Meloche says the disorganized protests were
becoming dangerous.

He says police received reports that some of the teens were being
intimidated by fellow students.

During the past few days, students have taken to the streets throughout
Quebec to express their frustrations.

"Windows of stores were broken, car windows were also broken," says
Montreal police spokesman Michel Fontaine, who added that police were
also pelted with rocks and garbage.

The students roved between two east-end high schools and drew between
300 and 400 students at the demonstration's peak.

Teachers' union officials say that while they do not agree with the
student demonstrations that are taking place during the school day, the
boycott of extra-curricular activities would continue.
