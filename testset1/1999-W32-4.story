The world may have to wait before people compete against human-sized
robots in a soccer game, but on Wednesday fans got to see robots play
soccer against each other.

At the third annual Robot World Cup Soccer tournament in Sweden, Iranian
robots beat Italian robots 3-1.

The teams play with five robots on each team. Each robot is about the
size of a microwave oven. The robots play on a field that about nine
metres long, and six metres wide. They are programmed to send signals to
each other on how to play during the game.

The president of the RoboCup Federation wants to have robots competing
against humans by the year 2050. He said the idea was not as far-fetched
as it may sound since IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer beat chess champion
Garry Kasparov.

The RoboCup tournament is getting more attention as robots with
artificial intelligence become smarter and faster. Almost a hundred
teams, from 24 countries took part in this year's tournament.

Organizers say these soccer games help us learn how to improve the
building of robots. They say the games will help develop robot
technology that can help in rescue operations, health care, traffic
systems and home entertainment.

Teams of human-size robots with two legs that walk and kick a ball are
expected to be competing in the 2002 tournament.

The RoboCup will be held in Australia next year.
