TEXT:

Crash investigators in England have begun looking for the causes of a
train crash that killed at least 27 people and injured 160 near a London
rail station yesterday.

The trains collided at 8:11 a.m., three kilometres west of London's
Paddington Station.

A British Broadcasting Corporation reporter says the initial
investigation suggests one of the trains passed one red and two yellow
warning signals before hitting the other train.

Meanwhile, the search for more victims resumed at dawn today. Rescue
workers picked through the wreckage, trying to account for missing
passengers.

Of the 150 people taken to area hospitals, reports say at least 14 are
seriously injured.

Many passengers cried as they described how they frantically crawled out
broken windows in the aftermath. Others said they were haunted by the
cries of those trapped in the wreckage.

Authorities could not determine the total number of passengers aboard
the trains.

Great Western and Thames Trains are the companies that operate the two
trains involved in the crash.

Great Western said as many as 500 people might have been on board its
train, which originated in Cheltenham, northwest of London, and was
minutes away from its destination of Paddington Station. The Thames
train, which may have been carrying up to 150 passengers, had just
pulled out of the London station.

Reports said both trains were traveling about 100 km/h when the Thames
train tried to cross in front of the Great Western train.

Rail travel is a way of daily life for many people in London and its
surrounding communities. About 800,000 people travel into and around
London by train everyday.

Tuesday's accident was Britain's worst rail crash since December 1988,
when three trains collided outside London's Clapham Junction, killing 35
people.
