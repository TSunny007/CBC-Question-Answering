TEXT:

Students at Iqaluit's Inuksuk High School are celebrating the revival of
their music program with singer Susan Aglukark, pizza and a $10,000
cheque today.

Born in Churchill, Manitoba, 28 years ago, Susan Aglukark moved around
the Northwest Territories for the first twelve years of her life with
her father (a Pentecostal minister), her mother and seven brothers and
sisters. They eventually settled in Arviat, Northwest Territories, a
community of 1,300 people on the northwest shore of Hudson Bay.

The Canadian singing star made a special appearance at the high school
to present officials with a $10,000 cheque for the purchase of music
instruments.

The cheque, and an accompanying pizza party, are courtesy of the Canadian
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Inuksuk has been without a music
program for about 10 years.

This fall a music teacher was hired and the program was revived with
money from the Baffin Divisional Education Council.

Inuksuk's new music teacher, Ryan MacLeod, is now building a program
from scratch with the help of the new instruments.

The money went towards the purchase of 10-15 instruments. In total
Inuksuk spent $40,000 on instruments this year, says Inuksuk
co-principal Ken Sykes. The instruments arrived at the beginning of the
school year.

Students can rent instruments from the South, but MacLeod says running a
successful music program in the North often requires providing
instruments for students.

"We have a wider variety of economic backgrounds here. For some students
where food and shelter is a more pressing concern, it is the
responsibility of the music society and of the school to provide an
instrument," MacLeod says.

About 90 students, or a quarter of the school's population, are enrolled
in music classes at Inuksuk. A single instrument is often shared between
two or three students. MacLeod says that, ideally, each student should
have his or her own instrument.

MacLeod says it is common for northern communities to rally behind music
programs.

Music is often considered to be as important as subjects such as math or
English, but it is a program that can give back to the community, he
says.

For example, the music society will be able to use the school's
instruments and students may perform at community events, MacLeod said.

"Musicians can go out and perform and allow people to experience
different emotions," MacLeod said.
