TEXT:

Fifteen-year-old Amber Ramirez is recovering in hospital after having
part of her brain removed. Amber had the surgery to control a disease
she has suffered from her whole life.

Amber suffers from Rasmussen's disease.

Rasmussen's disease is a very rare form of brain disease that can occur
at any time in childhood. It affects only about 1,000 people around the
world.

It is not known what causes the disease, but it is known that cells in
one half of the brain become inflamed, or puffy when infected. As a
result, the affected brain cells malfunction, and fire off electrical
energy when they are not supposed to.

This energy causes epileptic seizures. Seizures cause a violent jerking
of the arms and legs, and are difficult to control with medication.

Amber had the left side of her brain removed.

The left side of the brain controls speech and some body movements, so
the surgery could leave Amber without the ability to talk. But if she
had not had the surgery, she could have had difficulty moving, learning,
and maybe even died.

The surgery performed on Amber is called a hemispherectomy, and is
usually performed on younger patients.

Amber's surgeon says she is in fair condition following her nine-hour
surgery.
