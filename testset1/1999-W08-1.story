HEADLINE: President Clinton Acquitted in Trial

TEXT:

The trial of the American president ended Friday when he was found not
guilty of both charges against him.

President Clinton was acquitted of the charge of perjury (lying in
court) and of obstructing justice (hiding evidence, or getting others to
lie in court). Both are very serious offences. If found guilty, Clinton
would have been removed as president of the United States.

The Senate, which is made up of 100 senators, needed 67 votes to impeach
Clinton on either charge. The senators were split 50-50 on the charge of
obstruction of justice, and only 45 voted Clinton "guilty" on the charge
of perjury.

There are two parties in the Senate, the Democrats and the Republicans.
The Republicans are the majority with 55 seats. They were for the
impeachment, but in order to get 67 votes, they needed some of the
Democrats to support them. The Democrats, however, felt that there
wasn't enough public support to remove the president from office.

And they were right. Although most Americans believe Clinton acted
immorally, they don't think his actions were serious enough to impeach
him. They grew very weary of the impeachment. In fact, Clinton's
approval rating climbed during the trial, which means Americans think he
is still fit to be their president.

Clinton had denied having an affair with White House intern, Monica
Lewinsky, but later admitted that he did have a relationship with her.

It was his attempts to hide it that led to the charges against him.
Republican senators claim Clinton tried to get Lewinsky to lie, but she
says it was her own decision to cover up the affair.

After the trial, Clinton said he was "profoundly sorry" for how he
handled the situation.
