HEADLINE: Sarah McLachlan Wins Court Case

TEXT:

A Vancouver, British Columbia, judge has thrown out a copyright lawsuit
against Canadian pop singer Sarah McLachlan.

The Grammy and Juno-award winning singer is very relieved, says her
lawyer.

British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Bruce Cohen dismissed the lawsuit
by Darryl Neudorf.

Neudorf wanted money and credit for four songs he says he helped write
for McLachlan's 1988 debut album, "Touch".

Neudorf, a former drummer with the band 54-40, was recruited to help the
then-promising 19-year-old McLachlan, who had just recently moved to
Vancouver from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to pursue a career as a recording
artist.

The producer testified he was hired - without a written contract - to
help McLachlan develop songs for her first contract because she had
never written songs before.

He said he did not receive proper royalties for producing "Touch," which
sold more than 625,000 copies.

McLachlan and the other defendants rejected Neudorf's claims, suggesting
he was not hired to write songs, but rather to do pre-production work.

They said Neudorf was properly compensated, receiving about $4,000 in
wages and royalties worth 16 cents on each "Touch" album sold.

McLachlan's lawyer Jennifer Conkie said the performer - the mastermind
of the popular Lilith Fair concert series that toured North America - is
"very, very pleased and relieved."

"I think she shrieked with delight," Conkie said.

During the trial, McLachlan occasionally sang and played a keyboard
before court staff, reporters and teenaged fans to illustrate how
songs are put together.
