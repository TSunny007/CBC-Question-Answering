TEXT:

Some little fish have become a big threat in Lake Ontario.

Environment Canada is warning people in Ontario about a foreign fish
called the round goby.

The round goby is reducing precious sport fish stocks in the lake. This
is important because sport fishing for small mouth bass, walleye and
lake trout is a multi-million dollar industry.

The round goby is about the size of a sardine. It is dangerous because
it leaves almost no food for other fish. It eats the eggs and young of
the sport fish and chases larger fish away from food sources, leaving
little for them to eat.

The round goby also has the advantage of being able to feed right
through the night. It can do this because it has special sensors.

The Fisheries and Oceans Department says the round goby makes life
miserable for fishers too, because they steal bait and will also hit
lures. In many cases, the fishermen are finding that all they can catch
are goby.

The round goby came from the Black Sea, likely in water held in the
bottom of a boat.

The fish is already well established in Lake Erie and Lake Superior.
Officials hope to prevent it from spreading into other Canadian lakes
and rivers.

The Fisheries and Oceans Department says people can help control the
goby population by not using the fish as bait, and by not transferring
them from one body of water to another. Also, if they have a boat to
make sure they clean off plants that might have small goby in them. The
officials hope these measures will keep the round goby from taking over
the waterways of central Canada.
