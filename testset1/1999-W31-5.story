TEXT:

Eugene Shoemaker may finally fulfill his lifelong wish to go to the moon.

If all goes as planned on Saturday, a lipstick-sized container will
carry his ashes to the moon's south pole.

Shoemaker will be the first human to be laid to rest on another
celestial body. His ashes will be aboard NASA's Lunar Prospector.

The Lunar Prospector is a moon-orbiting craft. It is expected to crash
land on the moon early Saturday morning. NASA is hopeful that the impact
of Prospector's crash into the moon will create a plume of water which
will be visible from Earth with a telescope. NASA scientists are hopeful
that this experiment will help them learn about the moon's water
reserves.

Shoemaker was a well-known astronomer and geologist. He was considered
an authority on craters and the collisions that cause them. He is
credited with discovering about 20 comets and 800 asteroids. Shoemaker
gained worldwide fame in 1994, when he helped discover the comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9. The comet slammed into Jupiter in 1994.

It was always Shoemaker's dream to go to the moon. He applied to be an
astronaut in the 1960s, but was rejected because of a medical problem.
He later worked on several U.S. space missions, including the Apollo
missions to the moon. He taught Apollo astronauts about craters.

Shoemaker said shortly before his death the biggest disappointment in
his life was "not going to the moon and banging on it with my own
hammer."
