Ross Watson, a town councillor from Cochrane, Alberta, is hoping to become the first blind climber to reach the peak of Canada's highest mountain.

Watson plans to join a team of six other climbers this May on a journey to 
the top of the 5,945-metre Mount Logan in the Yukon Territory.

Watson is a big fan of the outdoors who describes himself as a "scrambler" 
when it comes to climbing.

Ten years ago Watson was part of a team that scaled Alaska's Mount McKinley 
- North America's highest mountain. The team came within six hours of reaching 
the top, but were forced to turn back after surviving 21 days in temperatures 
around -40 Celsius.

The 49-year-old Watson, who lost his vision from a pellet gun at the age of 
12, says his lack of technical climbing ability is more of a challenge than his 
blindness.

"I have to quote one of my fellow climbers who said, 'When (sighted people) 
are climbing, we look down and we get scared because the wrong messages are rolling through our heads. Ross doesn't have anything rolling through his head.'"

Watson won't be content to quit after he reaches the top of Canada's highest 
mountain peak. He plans to reach even bigger heights, like the world's tallest 
mountain - Mount Everest.

"I would love to be invited on an Everest team. It would certainly mean some 
dedicated training, but it would be an experience."
