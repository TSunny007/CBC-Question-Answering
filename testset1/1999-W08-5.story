A new Canadian radar satellite sees too much, too clearly, according to
NASA, 
the American space agency. NASA is refusing to send the Radarsat-2
satellite into 
the sky.

The United States government says the Canadian satellite provides images
that 
are too revealing for national security. The Radarsat-2 can see objects
as small as 
three metres through clouds and darkness.

"Anything below five metres causes concern to the U.S. intelligence
community," 
said Hugues Gilbert, director of strategic development for the Canadian
Space 
Agency. "But we think that having the three-metre resolution is really
crucial 
to Canadian industry."

The ability of this "eye in the sky" to see such detail would give
Canada a 
competitive edge over the U.S. in the business of earth resources
imagery. These satellites 
can help farmers forecast crop yields, keep track of ice conditions in
the Arctic ocean 
and help mining companies look for mineral
resources.

The Radarsat-2 satellite is owned and operated by Macdonald Dettwiler of 
Richmond, British Columbia, near Vancouver. It cost 300 million
dollars. The government 
of Canada paid for three-quarters of that cost.

The government may pay another space agency to launch the satellite.
