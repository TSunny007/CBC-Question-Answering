Former CBC broadcaster Adrienne Clarkson was installed as Canada's 26th
Governor General yesterday morning.

Ms. Clarkson took the Oath of Office in front of Supreme Court of Canada
Justice Claire L'Heureux Dube.

The Governor General must also swear the Oath of Allegiance, the Oath of
Office and Oath of Keeper of the Great Seal of Canada.

The Governor General formally takes office once the oaths have been
sworn and assumes the title "Excellency" while in office, and the
lifetime title of "Right Honourable". The Governor General's spouse is
also referred to as "Excellency".

The installation of a Governor General in Ottawa is a major state
occasion. Many of Canada's political leaders, including Prime Minister
Jean Chretien, Supreme Court Chief Justice Antonio Lamer, the cabinet,
and Opposition Leader Preston Manning attended the ceremony.

During a speech, Ms. Clarkson fought back tears as she praised her
92-year-old father, and her mother whom she said was there in spirit.

She recalled her family's arrival as refugees from Hong Kong in 1942. In
her speech she quoted poets and philosophers, including her husband John
Ralston Saul in praising Canada's struggle to create a country filled
with tolerance and civility.

Ms. Clarkson also thanked teachers whom she said treated her as "bright,
not bright yellow."

As Governor General, Ms. Clarkson represents the Queen of England, who
is the legal head of the Canada. Past Governor Generals include Lord
Stanley, who the Stanley Cup is named after, and Lord Grey, who the Grey
Cup is named after.

Some of the Governor General's responsibilities include giving Royal
Assent to bills passed by the House of Commons and the Senate, signing
State documents, opening and ending sessions of Parliament, and
dissolving Parliament for an election. She also presides over the
swearing-in of the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of Canada and
cabinet ministers.

Next week Clarkson will read the speech from the throne to open the new
session of parliament.
