TEXT:

Canadian film maker Deepa Mehta is finding out that making a movie in India is 
never easy.

On Sunday, some members of the Hindu religion destroyed the sets for her latest 
film, Water.

The protesters accuse Mehta of insulting Hindu traditions with her story of 
Indian widows in the 1930s. Water is the third in a controversial trilogy (a set 
of three) of films by the Indian-born film maker. Her other two films were entitled Earth and Fire.

Mehta had obtained permission to shoot the film from the Indian federal Information and Broadcasting Ministry, as well as the government of the state where the film is being shot.

But after the attack by fundamentalists (strongly religious people who refuse anything that disagrees with their faith), Indian government authorities withdrew their permission to shoot the film in Varanasi. Varanasi is considered one of India's oldest and most religious cities.

Now, after a meeting with the federal Information and Broadcasting minister, Mehta has been given permission to resume shooting.

Mehta says the attack has cost the production about a million dollars in damage and delays in the shooting schedule.

Last year, Mehta's film, Fire, was pulled from theatres in India after violent protests by Hindu nationalists. That film was about the relationship of two women caught in unhappy marriages.

Earth treated another controversial subject: the partition of India in 1947. Beginning in 1858, India was ruled by the British. Many millions of Indians did not want to be a British Colony. They wanted to run their own country.

Mahatma Gandhi organized huge protest marches, which forced Britain to hand over power. But when they did so they divided the country into two - India in the south, where a majority of the population believes in the Hindu religion, and Pakistan in the north, where the majority of the population believes in the Muslim religion.

Deepa Mehta's films are available in most video rental stores.
