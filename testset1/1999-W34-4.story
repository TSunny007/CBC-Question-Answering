HEADLINE: Earthquake Shakes Turkey

TEXT:

An powerful earthquake shook a densely populated part of western Turkey
early Tuesday.

The centre of the earthquake hit Izmit, the region just south of
Istanbul, the country's capital. Izmit is about 90 kilometres southeast
of Istanbul on the Sea of Marmara. The area has a population of about
one million. The earthquake hit at about 3 o'clock in the morning,
while many people were still sleeping.

Rescue workers spent hours digging through the rubble, frantically
trying to save people trapped under concrete and metal. The earthquake
has reportedly killed more than 6,000 people, and left at least 21,000
injured.

Because of the number of injuries, Turkish hospitals are overcrowded,
and can't take anymore patients. As a result, many of the earthquake
victims were being treated on the streets.

The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.8, according to the National
Earthquake Information Centre in Colorado. Magnitude measures the amount
of energy released by an earthquake.

An observatory in Istanbul said more than 250 aftershocks followed the
first tremor. Aftershocks are vibrations that follow an earthquake.

Officials have warned people not to return to buildings with even some
sign of structural damage, for fear there may be more collapses.

Despite the much higher death toll, Tuesday's earthquake wasn't quite as
powerful as a 1906 earthquake in San Francisco which had a magnitude of 7.9.

Canada sent disaster assistance troops to Turkey on Wednesday night. The
group is trained in communication and providing medical assistance.
