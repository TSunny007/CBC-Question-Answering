Adrienne Clarkson calls it a sign of Canadian evolution.

She's the first immigrant to be named Canada's governor general.

The 60-year-old Clarkson was born in Hong Kong in 1939, but came to
Canada as a refugee with her family in 1942.

She says she remembers a cold and snowy Ottawa with "white people"
everywhere.

Clarkson says the country has evolved since then, when minorities were
much less visible.

Ms. Clarkson says Prime Minister Jean Chretien approached her "early in
the summer" about replacing Governor-General Romeo LeBlanc, who had
asked to step down.

She says she plans to play an active, yet sensible role in Canadian
unity.

For example, Clarkson says, she and her husband, author John Ralston
Saul, plan to use the governor general's Quebec City residence, the
Citadel, more often.

Clarkson says it's important people remember how Canada was founded on
two languages along with native peoples.

Clarkson, who currently heads the board of the Canadian Museum of
Civilization, officially replaces Romeo LeBlanc on Oct. 7.

LeBlanc, who will be 72 in December, was appointed in 1995.

"I am very humbled by the idea of serving beyond, really, what I could
ever have expected to do for my country," said Clarkson. "I will do my
best to live up to that and to give the best of myself to it."

"Madame Clarkson is admired and respected across Canada, a remarkable
Canadian of strong intellect, a profound sense of personal integrity,
warmth and humanity," Chretien said.

"Most important of all, she is a person who loves her adopted country
and its people. Her appointment is a reflection of the diversity and
inclusiveness of our society, an indication of how our country has
matured over the years."

Clarkson, who lives in Toronto, is best known for her career with
CBC-TV, where she was a high-profile interviewer and host for three
decades.

The Governor General, the legal head of the Canadian state, makes more
than 300 public appearances a year.
