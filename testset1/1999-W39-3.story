TEXT:

It took him four tries, but yesterday evening New Democratic Party
leader Gary Doer finally achieved what he set out to do: win a
provincial election and become the Premier of Manitoba.

After 11 long years as opposition leader, Doer finally beat Conservative
party leader Gary Filmon in yesterday's election.

Filmon has announced that he will now retire from politics.

During the Manitoba election campaign, the NDP spent a lot of time
talking about the problems of health care. Yesterday evening Mr. Doer
was talking about it again in his victory speech.

He promised to get rid of what has become known as "hallway
medicine." Many of Manitoba's hospitals are so crowded that doctors
have had to park patient's beds in the corridors.

But last night at least, it was a time to savor victory. Doer's wife
Ginny Devine says finally winning feels good.

"It's kind of an emotional experience. It's been a long haul. I'm very
happy with the outcome. It was a nail biter with some of those ridings
so tight," said Ms. Devine.

The NDP could still add one more seat to the 31 it has won officially.
There'll be a recount -- where every vote is counted again to make sure
there are no mistakes -- in the suburban Winnipeg riding of Assiniboia,
where Tory Linda McIntosh beat the NDP's Jim Rondeau by 3 votes.

The NDP took about 45 per cent of the popular vote last night, the
largest share the party has won since Howard Pawley swept Conservative
leader Sterling Lyon out of power in 1981.
