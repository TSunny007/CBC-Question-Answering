Amanda Scott is only seventeen years old, but she knows where her heart is: back 
on her family's farm near Brandon, Manitoba. She also knows firsthand how hard 
it is for farm families to make a living.

Reports of crisis on Canadian farms first became national news in the Fall 
of 1998. Government aid was promised to struggling farmers trying to keep their 
farms running. The crunch was particularly felt in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, 
among hog and grain farmers.

But instead of complaining, Amanda is going on stage. This Sunday she's going 
to be singing in Toronto, Ontario, with some of the best-known names in Canadian 
music. It is called The Family Farm Tribute. The concert is meant to open people's eyes to the growing farm crisis in Canada.

The lineup for the concert includes Gordon Lightfoot, Burton Cummings, Sylvia 
Tyson, Kevin Parent, Fred Penner and Sharon, Lois and Bram, as well as bands such 
as Wide Mouth Mason and Big Sugar.

"I know with my Dad the stress of not being able to get the crops in, it builds 
up, you know?", says Amanda. "And then also it's the pressure of continuing on 
with what your forefathers have started on the family farm."

The concert is being organized by Liberal Member of Parliament Dennis Mills. 
He says the concert will achieve two things. It will bring rural problems to the 
attention of an urban audience, and it will show the country that Toronto cares.

"People beyond the 416 area code [the area code for Toronto], especially in 
the West, tend to think we are an evil, uncaring, don't-give-a-damn-kind of community. I know that's not the case and I think an event like this brings us together as a nation."

The concert's not a sell-out yet. There were still 3,000 tickets available 
as of yesterday afternoon. Even if it's not packed to the rafters, Mills says 
the concert's message will still get out as people across the country can tune 
into the event live on CBC Newsworld.

Federal Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief and his provincial counterparts are 
meeting today in Ottawa, Ontario, to work out a new aid package for cash-strapped farmers. It could be worth as much as $1 billion.

CBC Online will be presenting a live webcast of The Family Farm Tribute starting at 1pm Eastern right here: http://cbc.ca/news/live/familyfarm.html.
