TEXT:

Funeral services were held over the weekend for Tyrell Dueck. The
13-year-old from Martensville, Saskatchewan died last Wednesday at a
hospital in Saskatoon.

Tyrell had a cancerous tumour in his leg. He and his parents refused 
traditional treatments, such as chemotherapy (radiation treatment) and
amputation. Instead they decided to use herbal, and alternative
treatments that included large doses of vitamins and a special diet.

The Saskatchewan government didn't think alternative medicine would
work, and felt Tyrell's parents were pressuring him to refuse
traditional medicine. The province went to court to force him to undergo
surgery for the cancer in his leg. Tyrell waited three months for
treatment as his case went through the courts.

When it was discovered the cancer had spread to Tyrell's lungs, the
province dropped the case.

Shortly after, Tyrell's parents took the boy to Mexico for the
alternative treatment. Doctors in Mexico said he was cancer-free. They
said that Canadian doctors got the diagnosis wrong.

Tyrell returned from Mexico in April. His condition got worse. Tyrell's
tumour started bleeding and he needed blood transfusions. He was
admitted to hospital and died Wednesday night.

Joe Bourgeault, a supporter of alternative medicine, helped raise
money to pay for Tyrell's treatment in Mexico. He says in Tyrell's case,
government interference meant alternative treatment may have been
delayed too long.

"Tyrell believed alternative cancer therapy was going to improve his
chances of survival. Had he been given that option, instead of being
withheld from it for three months, he could very well be fully recovered
today."

The funeral was held in Gruenthal, north of Saskatoon.
